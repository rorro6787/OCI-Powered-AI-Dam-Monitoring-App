## Features
This project focuses on water sustainability, using modern cloud infrastructure and AI modeling to provide historical and predictive data about water dams in Spain. It is a full-stack project leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and various technologies to build an interactive, secure platform for users. Below are the key features:

### Backend:
- **Oracle Autonomous Database**: A highly scalable, cloud-hosted database storing detailed information about water dams across Spain, along with 20 years of historical data.
- **Python Flask Server**: 
  - Acts as the backend for handling client requests.
  - Hosts an **ARIMA model** for time-series prediction, estimating the water levels of selected dams for the next 5 years.
  - Provides APIs that allow the frontend to fetch data and predictions.

### Frontend:
- **React & Next.js**: 
  - Responsive and dynamic web interface.
  - Users can input coordinates or enable geolocation to locate dams within a certain radius.
  - Displays a map with markers showing nearby water dams.
  - Shows historical graphs of water levels for selected dams from the past 20 years.

### AI & Prediction:
- **ARIMA Model**: Implemented in Python to predict water levels in the dams for the next 5 years based on historical data.

### Security Features:
- **Cybersecurity**:
  - Integration of **reCAPTCHA** to prevent bots.
  - Use of **Challenge-Response** mechanisms to secure endpoints.
  - **TLS protocol** for secure communication.
  - **Cloudflare** for protection against **DDoS** attacks and web scraping.

### Hosting:
- **Vercel**: Frontend hosting for high-performance web applications. URL pf the Vercel Hosted App: https://hackaton-knkj.vercel.app/embalses
- **Cloudflare**: Acts as a security layer to prevent DDoS attacks and optimize performance.
